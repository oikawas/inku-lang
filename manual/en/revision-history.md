## Revision Policy

- Treat `SPEC.ja.md` as the canonical product specification.
- Update the Japanese manual first, then carry the same intent into English.
- Record the relevant Web Build whenever UI behavior changes.
- Never record real hostnames, IP addresses, user names, secrets, or local service details in the manuals.
